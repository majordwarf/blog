Hello World! I'm Tejas Tank.

A sophomore undergraduate at Thakur College Of Science And Commerce, Mumbai, pursuing Computer Science. I like graphic designing, programming and exploring different fields of software development. Currently I also lead a developer's club at my college, where I mentor freshmen and teach them programming. Apart from programming I love playing MMORPGS, sandbox games and watching movies and TV series. I guess that's all!
